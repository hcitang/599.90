# Assignments

This component assessed based on completion, where you demonstrate competency on developing two simple AR examples.

The primary learning objective is to acquire the basic knowledge and practice the basic skills necessary to develop augmented reality applications.

## Weighting

| Component                                     | U/G | G  |
|-----------------------------------------------|-----|----|

## Submission

In both cases, you will have received the training on how to complete the assignment well in advance of the due date. I encourage you to submit early.

To submit, simply send an email or slack DM to your TA with a link to your github repo for the project. The repo should include a screenshot and explanation of what the TA should expect to see and do when she tries running your code.
