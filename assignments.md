# Assignments

This component assessed based on completion, where you demonstrate competency on developing two simple AR examples.

The primary learning objective is to acquire the basic knowledge and practice the basic skills necessary to develop augmented reality applications.

## Weighting

| Component                                     | U/G | G  |
|-----------------------------------------------|-----|----|
| Assignment 1 (A1): AR Hello World             | 5   | 2  |
| Assignment 2 (A2): AR Embodied Hello World    | 10  | 3  |

## Submission

In both cases, you will have received the training on how to complete the assignment well in advance of the due date. I encourage you to submit early.

To submit, simply send an email to your TA with a link to your github repo for the project. The repo should include a screenshot and explanation of what the TA should expect to see and do when she tries running your code.

## Assignment 1: AR Hello World 

_(due Fri, Feb 1 EOD)_

Using Unity3D and EasyAR (or another AR tool if you prefer), create a simple augmented reality application.
	* Download a character from the Asset Store (or, if youâ€™re feeling ambitious, try creating your own!)
	* Recognize elements of the physical environment in your application (this can be either image targets or the environment itself)
	* Program your character to move between at least three points in the scene.
	* Trigger an exciting event when the character reaches its final point!

## Assignment 2: AR Embodied Hello World 

(due Fri, Mar 1 EOD)
