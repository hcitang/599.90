# Design of Mixed Reality Applications

Recent innovations in mobile computing technologies, including computing power, sensor fusion, miniaturization of display technology and wireless data are making mixed reality applications a near term reality. This course explores both the social consequences of mixed reality applications, and prepares students for technical challenges of designing such applications. Beyond learning the technical skills to develop these applications and understanding the implications of different input modalities for them, students will learn how to critically design and evaluate mixed reality applications.

## Meetings
* Lab: Wednesdays 4:00-5:50 (MS156)
* Discussion: Fridays 12:00-2:45 (ST063)

This course is run as a 2-2: two hours in the lab for hands-on training with development and project time, and two hours for discussion and presentations about mixed reality topics.

## Office Hours
* Fridays, 2:45-4:00 (MS680B), and
* By request
