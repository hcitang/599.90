# Project

In a team (3+ members), you will design a mixed reality user experience for a client. You will meet with your client on a regular basis, working to understand the problem space, design the user experience, develop the user experience, as well as evaluate the user experience to the best of your ability. Your goal here is not to have a "finished product", instead, we are looking for a prototype that illustrates and communicates the user experience of the application.

You will be assessed on the quality and clarity of the communication for each sub-component here. You will also be assessed on your engagement with your client: document your preparations for each meeting, along with the outcomes from that meeting. Finally, you will be evaluated on the final outcome of your project, though you will describe how you expect your project to be evaluated (more on this below).

## Clients

Your project will be defined (at least in the early stages) by clients. These are companies or organizations that would like to have a mixed reality application designed and built.

Because you are not the "customer" of this application, you will want to meet with your client on a regular basis to ensure that you are designing something that meets their expectations. The goal is quality over quantity. A reasonable rule of thumb is to meet with your client at least once every two weeks or so to describe progress, ask questions, etc.

## Part 0: Mini-Proposal

Develop a one paragraph mini-proposal that describes the basic idea for the project, the client, the team members (and their anticipated "roles"), and whatever else you think Tony should know.

To submit, create a submission channel for your group in Slack (e.g. #teamCoolSubmission), and add Tony. Submit the paragraph as a message to the message with me @'ed.

## Part 1: Proposal

The proposal should provide a clear picture of who the client is, what you are planning on designing and developing, a set of early sketches that you have already shared (along with feedback from your client), a tentative rubric for how you expect your project to be evaluated, and a timeline for your project.

You will develop and give a five-minute presentation (PPT) based on your proposal.

Criteria for evaluation on this component:

* How clear is the goal of the project?
* How clear is the outcome of the project from a user experience perspective? (illustrated via the sketches/prototypes)
* How has the team engaged with the client, to what extent have they sought to provide feedback, and is it clear how they will make use of that feedback?
* How realistic is the timeline?
* How appropriate is the evaluation rubric?

This component should be submitted as a PDF report via your Slack submission channel. Sketches should be included in the document (or via self-contained zip file if using some external tool). Summaries of interactions with your clients should be included as an appendix.

## Part 2: Progress Report and Critique

This report should provide a clear understanding of the expected user experience, the challenges your team has faced, and how you will resolve or address these challenges. You should provide a video prototype of your expected user experience, where components that have been developed should be shown in "working" order, and the other components mocked up. Much like your proposal, your progress report should illustrate the depth of your interaction with your client (feedback you have received, along with how you will address the feedback). It should also revisit your timeline, and also the rubric for how you expect your project to be evaluated. New to this component is a tentative plan for evaluating the mixed reality user experience.

You will develop and give a ten-minute presentation (PPT) based on your progress, and engage in a constructive critique session with your fellow classmates.

Criteria for evaluation on this component:

* How clear is the goal of the project?
* How clear is the outcome of the project from a user experience perspective? (illustrated via the sketches/prototypes)
* How has the team engaged with the client, to what extent have they sought to provide feedback, and is it clear how they will make use of that feedback?
* How realistic is the timeline?
* How appropriate is the evaluation rubric?

## Part 3: Final Report

To be announced.
