# Project

In a team (3+ members), you will design a mixed reality user experience for a client. You will meet with your client on a regular basis, working to understand the problem space, design the user experience, develop the user experience, as well as evaluate the user experience to the best of your ability. Your goal here is not to have a "finished product", instead, we are looking for a prototype that illustrates and communicates the user experience of the application.

You will be assessed on the quality and clarity of the communication for each sub-component here. You will also be assessed on your engagement with your client: document your preparations for each meeting, along with the outcomes from that meeting.

## Clients

Your project will be defined (at least in the early stages) by clients. These are companies or organizations that would like to have a mixed reality application designed and built.

Because you are not the "customer" of this application, you will want to meet with your client on a regular basis to ensure that you are designing something that meets their expectations. The goal is quality over quantity. A reasonable rule of thumb is to meet with your client at least once every two weeks or so to describe progress, ask questions, etc.
