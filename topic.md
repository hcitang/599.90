# Topics

In a pair, you will develop a discussion on a topic of your choice, where you will prepare a web-based handout, identify readings, and an in-class presentation on the chosen topic. As a pair, you will generally be made up of one grad student and one undergrad student. These pairings should be distinct from the project teams. The primary learning objective here is to develop both a depth of understanding in a specific area relating to mixed reality experience design, and articulating that understanding in a way that is appropriate for an audience of your peers.

## Outline
* Format
    * 3-0 Format: Students will need to learn the skills by themselves. Our main task will be to provide online resources for them to go to. I think running it this way will mean doing a 2-hour lecture/discussion, and a 1-hour mini-tutorial.
    * 2-2 Format: My preferred way of running the course. Two hours of lecture/discussion throughout the term. Lab for the first few weeks will be building core skills for working with Unity and either Vuforia, AR Toolkit and the Google AR API.
    * 3-2 Format: I actually don't know what I would do with them for three hours in lecture/discussion.

* Lectures/Discussion: Seminar-style - mini-lectures followed by discussion. The two or three hour discussions happen all at once, and the lab happens all at once (i.e. as a two hour block)

* Topic Areas
    * Introduction to MR
    * Society and MR (critical reading/evaluation)
    * Embodied Interaction
    * Evaluating MR
    * Future MR
