# Assessment Components

This is a project-based course with seminar-style components. Thus, you will be evaluated on your completion of written and coding components, contributing to both online and in-person discussion, as well as your engagement with your client.

While the components for each undergrad and graduate students are essentially the same, the weighting is different.

## Component Weighting

| Component                         | Undergrads | Grads    |
|-----------------------------------|------------|----------|
| [Assignments](assignments.md)     | 15         | 5        |
| [Participation](participation.md) | 25         | 20       |
| [Topic](topic.md)                 | 5          | 20       |
| [Project](project.md)             | 55         | 55       |

## Components

### [Assignments](assignments.md) (u: 15; g: 5)

You will complete two assignments, where the primary learning objective of each is to give you the basic development skills to deliver on the project.

### [Participation](participation.md) (u: 25; g: 20)

You will actively participate in in-class and online dicussions. In a typical week, you will respond online to a discussion question regarding a reading for the week. This response is to prepare you for an in-class discussion about the topic and reading. The primary learning objective for this style of participation is to help you to develop both oral and written communication and critical thinking skills. I am interested here less in your ability to simply regurgitate the information you have taken in, and more in your ability to think beyond the material, bringing in ideas and thoughts of your own to bear on the topic at hand. I will provide you ongoing feedback about your performance on your participation.

### [Topic](topic.md) (u: 5; g: 20)

In a pair, you will develop a discussion on a topic of your choice (ideally selected from the set of available [topics](topic.md)), where you will prepare a web-based handout, identify readings, and an in-class presentation on the chosen topic. As a pair, you will generally be made up of one grad student and one undergrad student. These pairings should be distinct from the project teams. The primary learning objective here is to develop both a depth of understanding in a specific area relating to mixed reality experience design, and articulating that understanding in a way that is appropriate for an audience of your peers.

### [Project](project.md) (u/g: 55)

The project is the primary "development" component of this course. Here, you will design and develop a mixed reality experience based on your interactions with a "client." You will be assessed on your engagement with your client (via documentation), a clear articulation of what you expect to develop (in the proposal), and a clear articulation of what you have developed (in the final report) based on feedback from your clients and your peers. This is a team-based project component, though the size of your project team is up to you (my recommendation is to select a team size of three peers or more).

I expect you to blow our socks off. I want ours to be the best projects at the annual CPSC Showcase event. And, I want these projects to be the way in which you communicate the outcomes of your degree to the outside world.

This component has several learning objectives: first, you will learn how to design a mixed reality experience; second, you will learn how to engage with clients (potentially through various failure modes) and to use that feedback to improve your project design; third, you will learn how to work in a team to partition tasks, and finally, you will learn how to present your work in a way that highlights your design process.

* The idea is for this course to be project based, but with seminar-style components (i.e. students teach each other).
* Assignments: Individual assignments. A1 is evaluated based on communication clarity. A2&A3 are evaluated based on completion.
    * Three simple assignments, one social, two technical
    * A1-Phase 0: Identify an existing AR application, download, try, demo and critique
    * A1-Phase 1: Pick a real-life domain, generate five ideas on how to support it in MR
    * A1-Phase 2: Trade with someone else, and critique those ideas, generate two new ideas on how to support that domain
    * A2: Implement a simple Unity-based MR
    * A3: Implement MR interaction with some interaction modality (built-in gestures, voice, head orientation, other)
* Project - A three-person team to develop a mixed reality application in a novel domain
    * Proposal - Presentation
    * Progress update - Presentation
    * Demo and Final Presentation
    * Visual Storyboard and Project Report
* Topic Presentation/Participation
    * Assigned topics, where topics are outlined by the instructor (say by readings or a paper)
    * If there are enough grads, they will lead the discussion. UGrads will pose a discussion point, and others are to respond online as well as in the in-class discussion 

* Grad evaluation
    * Essentially the same with three variations:
        * Assignments are not worth anything, but literally based on completion
        * Topic presentation is worth more, and needs to be more comprehensive
        * Final paper needs to be phrased as a research proposal, where: (1) problem is articulated; (2) backed and supported with related work; (3) current work articulated, and (4) proposed "future steps" well articulated
        * If there are enough grads enrolled, then they will lead the topics, and the ugrads will simply provide discussion points

## Outline
* Format
    * 3-0 Format: Students will need to learn the skills by themselves. Our main task will be to provide online resources for them to go to. I think running it this way will mean doing a 2-hour lecture/discussion, and a 1-hour mini-tutorial.
    * 2-2 Format: My preferred way of running the course. Two hours of lecture/discussion throughout the term. Lab for the first few weeks will be building core skills for working with Unity and either Vuforia, AR Toolkit and the Google AR API.
    * 3-2 Format: I actually don't know what I would do with them for three hours in lecture/discussion.

* Lectures/Discussion: Seminar-style - mini-lectures followed by discussion. The two or three hour discussions happen all at once, and the lab happens all at once (i.e. as a two hour block)

* Topic Areas
    * Introduction to MR
    * Society and MR (critical reading/evaluation)
    * Embodied Interaction
    * Evaluating MR
    * Future MR

## Topics
* Situated and embedded visualizations
* ARToolkit
* Apple's ARKit
* Google's AR toolkit
* AR in museums
* AR collaboration
* AR in mechanical work
* Everyday AR
* Mixed Reality _in_ Games
* MR Games
